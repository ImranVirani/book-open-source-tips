=== Accessible

Make the project **Accessible**.

This has 2 areas:


==== Lower the barrier to entry

Allow all people, juniors to seniors to be part of the community & contribute.

* GitHub template <<_github_template_files,more information>>
* Automated tests <<_automation_tests_continuous_integration_ci_continuous_deployment_cd,more information>>
* ...

==== The resulting product needs to cater for all

Access by everyone regardless of disability (e.g. visually impaired) is critical to the success of any project.

For example:

* Alternative `alt` text for images
* Keyboard input as well as mouse
* Transcripts for videos
* ...and much more!
* a good place to look for ideas would be https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/

TIP: Be inclusive
